## 🧾 Assumptions Made

- User authentication is handled externally. The app assumes that a valid user session or token already exists and does not include login or authentication logic.

- No CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind) was specified in the instructions, so I implemented the required styles manually using SCSS for full control and customization.

- Assumed API returns paginated responses
